# cosmic_string

definition:
-------------------
- Cosmic strings are considered as 1D hypothetical objects which formed in the early Universe. They can be considered as the Universe cracks thay might survive to present day. Discovery of these objects will cause a major effect on cosmology as well as string theory.

- Currently, (observational) cosmologists are trying to detect them through different observations. Because we do not have any evidence, people simulate the impact of these strings on CMB.

Purpose:
------------
In this repo, I construct an practical approach towards identification of strings in CMB patches. With larger data, the resuls will be more accurate and reliable.

Result:
--------
After extracting feature using CNN network (and pytorch!), I used three different machine learning methods. The best strategy was Random Forest with 81% accuracy.
